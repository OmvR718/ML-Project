This the Logistic Regression Classificastion of Eyes image Dataset
the Dataset contains 4172 images with various images and various sizes the have been resized and extracted from them using the HOG feature descriptor 
then a csv files was written using pandas and numpy that has a 4172 row each row has 8193 columns the last column has to be the value of of classfication label
being for the eye dataset #'cataract','diabetic retinopathy','normal','glaucoma'#(1,2,3,4)
since this is a logitic regression model it can only work with labels two labels only so we reduce the dataset by about 2000 row accounting for the two classes that we
will not be using in the binary classification so the our dataset's shape is reduced to (2112,8193)
our two classes are only diabetic_retinopathy and normal
we split our data into X,y and the split X and y into training and testing
we instantiate a logistic regression model named lr with a max_iter parameter =1000 which means it will iterate 1000 times before the coeffcients converge 
we use cross validation test to ensure that out model won't overfit assigning k-Folds to 5 and the metric is accuracy and we get nearly identical accuracies 
split the data into train and test and standarize it fit the model 
and make predictions for the positive class then apply a threshold for each predicion in the arrays which gives you the prediction for each label being 0 or 1 
a threshold is 0.8 which was used here 
we plot the confusion matrix which we can see from it that the there only 2 false prediction on the 1st class and 15 false predictions on the 2nd class
a  roc score of 0.96 score which indicates that the model has near perfect ability of discrimnation and it ensures threshold was chosen right 
we use PCA to reduce our data into  data with 2 feature to plot an innacurate but helpflul representation of our data's descion boundary
